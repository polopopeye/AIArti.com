The ```whichx.js``` (located in ```assets/scripts```) is where all the logic is and the rest (in ```assets/example```) of the project serves only as an example of how the ```whichx.js``` can be used. In the ```index.html``` we have an example of a classifier designed to guess which type of pet is being described in a short description. If you make any changes, please check that the example still works.

To get started making changes to the project you will need to;

1. Install node and npm.
2. Run ```npm install``` in the root of the project.
3. Run ```npm test -s``` to run the linters and unit tests.

As long as any changes you make pass all linting checks and unit tests, feel free to raise a pull request. Please write new tests for any changes you make.
